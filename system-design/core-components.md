## 1. Scalability Fundamentals

- **Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling:** Add more machines vs. increase resources on a single machine
- **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic efficiently across servers
- **Database Concepts:**
  - SQL vs. NoSQL
  - Sharding
  - Replication
  - Consistency models (e.g., eventual vs. strong consistency)

## 2. Caching & Messaging

- **Caching Strategies:**
  - Browser, CDN, application-level, and database-level caching
  - Cache eviction policies (e.g., LRU, LFU)
- **Message Queues & Pub/Sub:**
  - Decouple services using systems like Kafka, Amazon SQS
